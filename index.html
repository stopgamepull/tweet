The amount of work it took to get me to where I am today is beyond what most people can probably imagine.

How it works: * Anyone can deposit into Railgun. * After you deposit, there is a 1 hour period during which various algorithms detect whether or not the deposit likely came from what the algorithms consider to be criminal activity. * If your deposit passes the filter, then after 1 hour you can use ZKPs to withdraw privately (but ideally wait longer to get a good-enough anonymity set). * If your deposit fails the filter, then you can only withdraw back to your own address. There is no risk that your funds will get frozen/seized, you just can't benefit from the privacy pool. If you disagree with Railgun's filters, anyone is free to fork and make their own pool with their own rules, though if you can't get reasonably wide public support you're going to have a tiny anonymity set. https://railway.xyz",

The amount of work it took to get me to where I am today is beyond what most people can probably imagine.

They worked side-by-side, day after day, for years. Despite many setbacks and countless challenges, they never gave up. The amount of work it took to get me to where I am today is beyond what most people can probably imagine. My fellow prisoners often told me how fortunate I was to have a dedicated wife and mom like mine. Many people helped us along the way and we are deeply grateful to all of them. I would still be locked in a cell behind a prison wall were it not for all the support we received. THANK YOU!",
